## Pre-requisites for Using the Connector
1. Enable the Data API

        The Data API is disabled by default. To use the API, you need to turn it on in the Atlas UI for one or more clusters.
        Click Data API in the left navigation menu. On the following screen, select one or more clusters that you want to enable the API on from the dropdown menu and then click Enable the Data API.
2. Create a Data API Key

        The Data API uses project-level API keys to manage access and prevent unauthorized requests. Every request must include a valid Data API key.A Data API key grants full read and write access every collection in a cluster and can access any enabled cluster in the project.
        Click Create API Key, enter a unique name for the new key, and then click Create API Key.
        You can now see and copy your new API key for the first and only time. Once you close the modal, Atlas will never expose the value again.
